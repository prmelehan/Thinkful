# 1.4.1 Evaluating an Experiment Analysis

Some notes containing


## Experiment 1
### Experiment
The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.


### Critique & Room for Improvement

This test seems good at first, until you realize that two different people are issuing the slogan to their respective groups. This test can't be conclusive for 2 reasons.

##### 1) Sample Size & Bias
There are a very small number of Droids that we're sampling, 50 to be exact. In addition, these droids were captured from the Rebel Army most likely, making them more resistant to sith persuasion.

##### 2) Non-identical environments

Since darth vader issued one statement to only one group, and Palpatine the same, there could be some difference in tone, or general likability of Sith over the other.


To fix the environment problem, have one sith issue both statements, or break into groups of 4, having one group for each slogan for each sith. To fix the sample bias problem, randomly select droids or other creatures and issue an ad? "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy... visit sithlords.gov". Or something along those lines. Having a random sample and a larger sample would mimick the general population better than the current sample.

## Experiment 2
### Experiment
In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

### Critique & Room for Improvement

The main critique here is that we don't know the sample size for each planet for Mace and Jar Jar respectively. This makes it hard to rule out Simpson's Paradox, which is what I believe to be at play here.

To improve this, the test would need to take the sample sizes into account when evalutating overall ranking between Jar Jar & Mace Windu.

## Experiment 3
### Experiment
A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

### Critique & Room for Improvement

This would also fall victim to Simpson's Paradox, as the sample sizes are different, and the distribution of job title across countries is different. If IT works in countries with poor internet, no toilets, or horrible Uber drivers, then the average job satisfaction score might be lower than HR, when HR would have the same score if they were to live in those countries too.

The way we could improve this is to introduce the statisics by country, to get an understanding of where any potential skewness is coming from.

## Experiment 4
### Experiment
When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

### Critique & Room for Improvement

This experiment falls ill to selection bias, where the people sampled were people who said "OK, you can have my data". In addition, people to share their health data are probably more likely to be fit, or trying to become fit.

To fix this, mention that the sample is opt-in, and provide insights like Churn for non-activity sharing users (as that data is easily accessable).

## Experiment 5
### Experiment
To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

I think this is a problem with the grouping. First, did she write identical tests in a different order? If so, this wouldn't really make much sense.

To fix this she could just randomize the order of questions, and then randomize the test order. If she still wanted her current format, she could randomize the order of the tests as well.
