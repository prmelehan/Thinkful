# Regression or Classification

Determine whether the following questions should use classification or regression to predict their desired outcome


#### 1) The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 Hours

This should be a regression, as we want a continous output

#### 2) What car color is someone going to buy

This should be a classification, as you normally cannot choose the exact RGB value for your car paint color.


#### 3) How many children a family will have

This should be a regression. But: make sure that the output are integers. Because u really can't have a half a child

#### 4) If someone will sign up for a service

Classification. Simple binary answer. You could use Logistic Regression for this case

#### 5) The number of times someone will get sick in a year

This could be a regression but you would assume there to be some upper boundary, like 10?! You could also use classification if you never saw above a given value...

#### 6) The probability someone will get sick next month

Classification. This is a binary outcome, with a probability associated to each class, where the sum of the probabilities = 1. 90% chance Johnny will get sick, 10% chance he will not.

#### 7) Which medicine will work for a given patient

Classification
