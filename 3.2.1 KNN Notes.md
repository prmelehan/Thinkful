# KNN Classifier Notes

### Problem:
Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful?


### Potential Solution:

We can use KNN because whereas Naive Bayes can be fooled by so called "Baysian Poisoning", KNN is blind to correlated features as it is non-parametric. Naive Bayes' assumes a distribution, KNN does not. One downside is that KNN does not allow for feature explanation. I.e. what features are most important to the classification of this datapoint, and why...

To implement this model, I would use KNN, but use the z-scores of the values as the data points instead of the raw values as to **normalize** the data. This will give us distances with respect to the underlying distribution of each feature. In addition, if our dataset is dense enough, we might be able to get away with simple KNN, but if we have sparse data, let's weight by distance to ensure we're "pulling" the data point towards the correct class.
