# 2.1.3 Formulating Good Research Questions for Modeling

Categorize each of the following research questions as "good" or "bad", and provide alternative formulations for the bad ones

#### 1) What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
This is not a "research question" that we can use models to solve. It's very easily accessible data using Government Databases. Maybe we could change the question to "How can we predict if someone will be a juvenile deliquent in 1994, given past data"

#### 2) What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?

This is relatively good one, as it requires feature engineering / analysis. I.e. what features correlate to juvenile delinquency, i.e. lack of family, living in a high crime area, living in a low income area, poor public schools, etc. Using those learned features, how do we identify the most important one, and reduce it's effect (maybe better public schools, police, more available jobs, etc)


#### 3) Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?

This is also a very good, specific question. We'd have to quantify good education vs bad education, but that's semantics. One improvement would be to say "how much does education..." as to assign a numerical value to the importance of education, instead of a binary yes or no.

#### 4) How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?

This is not a model based question, because you can literally query this from their customer database. This is like a "census" question.

#### 5) What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?

This is good one, as it asks for ranking of features that lead customers to choose AT&T over other services. Those features can then be used to help influence customers to join AT&T in the future.

#### 6) How can AT&T attract more customers?

This needs some work, its too general. First, if we were to replace AT&T with a brand-new startup that had no customers, period, then we wouldn't have any past data to train a model with. We'd have to default to the population which might not represent the company we have. A better way might be "What is the best way to attract customer". The question is akin to asking "how can I make money". There are like a bajillion ways to make money, we need to focus our question to something more specific.

#### 7) Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?

This needs to be re-factored, such as "what was the highest contributing factor to the explosion of the Challenger Shuttle". That focuses our question on something we can measure quantitatively. "Why did the Challenger Explode" is just a bit too general, and might be a starting point for engineers, who then refine their questions to create research questions, which they can test and derive quantitative results from.


#### 8) Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?

This is a good one. By asking specifically which genes (or features) are associated, we can find the correlation for each gene, and rank them by risk.

#### 9) Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?

Too broad. Instead: "What time of the day has the largest impact on children's ability to follow and comprehend stories". Define "better". Like what do you mean by "better". "better" for their heart health, better for the development of the their teeth??


#### 10) How does Googleâ€™s search algorithm work?

This is crap. It's so broad. What part, define "search". Instead ask a question like "how much better is Google's page rank feature than DuckDuckGo's?"
