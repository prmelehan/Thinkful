# 1.4.5 Research Proposal

### Problem
User activity on our fitness App, "Happy Days Fitness Tracker" is crucial to attracting investors. We're up for a new round of funding soon, and we need impresive numbers to attract our next big investor. We need a way to effectively increase the number of weekly active sessions.

### Potential Solution
There is some data out there saying that re-targeting ads to previous viewers / users of the app can help branding / reduce churn. To test this theory, and potentially reduce churn and bring people back to the app, we will re-target people who downloaded the application, but who have not had an active session in over 2 weeks.

### Methods for Testing Solution

Find all users who have downloaded the App, but who have not had an active session in the past 2 weeks. Re-target an ad to those users on all platforms equally.

We will compute the weekly active sessions 2 months prior to the test. The test will last for 2 months, where we will measure the trend of weekly active users who **have** been targeted with the re-target ad, and compare the weekly usage with the control 2-month period. If we see 15% more weekly active users for the group that has a "stale" session period with ad-retarting, then we can conclude that ad retargeting is effective. If usage declines with ad-retargeting by less than 1 standard deviation, continue for another 2 months. If usage does not increase after those addition months, do not retarget ads.
